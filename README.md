@ Introduction to Firebase Authentication

Most applications need to know the identity of a user. knowing a users identity allows an application to securely save data in the cloud and provide the same personalized experience across all the user's devices.

Firebase Authentication is a free product from the firebase suit. It allows us to easily implement user authentication in any project whether it's a mobile or web app.

Firebase Authentication offers the possibility to authenticate a user through different providers, beyond email and password, Without writing any server-side code.

A provider can be Twitter, Github, Facebook and google, or even your custom authentication system, if you have one.

Firebase Authentication is really awesome to work with, due to it's out of the box powers and the fact that it's easily integrated into any backend or database.

You don't need to use the other firebase services in order to take advantage of firebase authentication.

From a JavaScript perspective, we save a lot of troubles when we don't have to handle the authentication ourselves.

For instance, we don't have to set up a database, encrypt passwords, manage the sessions and so on.

Though there is one thing you need to understand before we dive into the code.

Firebase Authentication is only an authentication system. This means that if you need to store additional user information, you have to store the user's data in your backend.

Don't worry too much about this now, we will cover it during this course.
